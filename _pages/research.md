## Working Papers

### Intensive and extensive margins of manufacturing exports: impact of commodity windfalls [Job market paper](http://papers.abrahamlartey.com/Abraham_Lartey_JMP.pdf){: .btn--research} 
How do commodity windfalls affect the number of exporters (extensive) or the average export value per exporter (intensive) within the manufacturing sector? A large body of theoretical and empirical literature showed that these windfalls could be detrimental to the manufacturing sector, but none untangled the margins through which the exports from the manufacturing sector adjusts to these windfalls. I exploit the exogenous variation in the windfalls generated by the increase in prices of all major commodities during the early 2000s to fill this gap in the literature.  I found that manufacturing industries that historically had a relatively higher share of exports to value added ratio (more- exportable) tend to be negatively affected relative to the other manufacturing industries at both margins. Secondly, the extensive margin is largely driven by entrants. i.e., the number of new firms that enter the export market for the more- exportable industries decline relative to the less exportable industries. Thirdly, for the more-exportable industries, the average export value per incumbent exporters of the more- exportable industries decline while that of the new exporters increases relative to the less exportable industries. This implies that commodity windfalls act as a cost push on both margins within the manufacturing sector, but the effect depends on the type of exporter.

### Impact of Kyoto Protocol on Green Growth 
Some recent studies provide causal evidence that suggest the Kyoto protocol (KP) led to a reduction in GHG emissions. What are the channels through which the KP led to GHG emissions reduction; increased renewable energy (RE) consumption, energy efficiency (EE) or both? In this paper, I examined the causal impact of the KP on RE and EE by combining the Entropy balancing method with a differences-in-differences technique to deal with endogeneity issues. This allowed me to compare countries legally bound by the KP to a comparable control group of countries not legally bound by the KP. The results showed that the KP led to an increase in RE but not significant impact on EE.

### Do Natural Resources make countries poor at taxation? [Working paper](http://papers.abrahamlartey.com/Abraham_Lartey_oilgastax.pdf){: .btn--research} 
I exploit the exogenous variation in the timing of giant oil and gas discoveries to estimate the causal impact of natural resources on taxation. It has often been argued that countries that produce natural resources mobilize less non-resource tax revenues than other countries. The timing of giant oil discoveries is arguably exogenous and thus renders them appealing to empirically examine this argument. This allows me to examine the performance of non-resource tax revenue effort before and immediately after discovery as well as the period corresponding to the inflow of revenues from the production. I found that non-resource tax revenues tend to increase for the first two years after a discovery. When I disaggregate non-resource tax revenues into direct and indirect components, I do find that non-resource indirect tax revenues tend to increase in both the preproduction and production periods. Further analysis shows that non-resource tax revenues experience an increase in non-high-income countries while the positive effect on indirect tax revenues in both the pre-production and production is present (absent) only in non-high income (high income) countries. This effect is largely driven by an increase in the consumption of goods and services. The results suggest that the abundance of natural resources might not be a reason why some of these countries mobilize less non-resource tax revenues.


### Chinese Development Aid and Agricultural Productivity: Evidence from Tanzania  [Working paper](http://papers.abrahamlartey.com/Abraham_Lartey_ChinaAgric.pdf){: .btn--research} [AidData Working paper](https://www.aiddata.org/publications/chinese-development-aid-and-agricultural-productivity-evidence-from-tanzania){: .btn--research} 
Improvement in agricultural productivity plays a key role in the process of economic development. Investment in critical infrastructure has been documented in the literature as one of the pathways to boost agricultural productivity. In this paper, I investigated whether foreign aid aimed at economic and social infrastructure can help improve agriculture productivity in Tanzania. I combined household panel data with rich farm level information with geocoded Chinese development projects. I then exploit the within village level variation in the total number of Chinese financed development projects in a panel fixed effects model to examine their effects on agricultural productivity. I find a positive effect on agricultural productivity in villages that are located within 25km of these projects. This is largely driven by economic infrastructure. The results are robust to alternative definitions of Chinese financed development projects. I also found that the mechanisms driving the results are commercialization and access to improved seeds. This suggests that these projects connect farmers to input and output markets.
