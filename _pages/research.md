### Intensive and Extensive Margin of manufacturing exports: impact of commodity windfalls [Job market paper](http://papers.abrahamlartey.com/Abraham_Lartey_JMP.pdf){: .btn--research} 

I exploit the exogenous variation in the windfalls generated by the increase in prices of all major commodities during the early 2000s to assess the impact of commodity windfalls on the intensive and margin of manufacturing exports. I found that the windfalls had a negative effect on both the intensive and extensive margins of the more exportable manufacturing products relative to the less exportable manufacturing products. However, the negative impact observed on aggregate at the extensive margin is largely driven by new exporters while that of the intensive margin is driven by incumbent exporters. The result underscores the fact all exporters are not alike, and the effects differ depending on the type of exporter. I also found that commodity windfalls increase the wages and decreases the labor productivity of the more exportable manufacturing products relative to low-exportable manufacturing products. This implies that commodity windfalls increase the cost of exporting and only the most productive firms can enter the market. Also, public expenditure experienced a significant boost during the boom era. However standard policy prescriptions such as expenditure rules are effective in dampening the effects of commodity windfalls at the extensive margin but not at the intensive margin. Natural resource funds on the other hand do not play any significant role in dampening the negative effects at both margins.

### Do Natural Resources make countries poor at taxation? [Working paper](http://papers.abrahamlartey.com/Abraham_Lartey_oilgastax.pdf){: .btn--research} 
I exploit the exogenous variation in the timing of giant oil and gas discoveries to estimate the causal impact of natural resources on taxation. It has often been argued that countries that produce natural resources mobilize less non-resource tax revenues than other countries. The timing of giant oil discoveries is arguably exogenous and thus renders them appealing to empirically examine this argument. This allows me to examine the performance of non-resource tax revenue effort before and immediately after discovery as well as the period corresponding to the inflow of revenues from the production. I found that non-resource tax revenues tend to increase for the first two years after a discovery. When I disaggregate non-resource tax revenues into direct and indirect components, I do find that non-resource indirect tax revenues tend to increase in both the preproduction and production periods. Further analysis shows that non-resource tax revenues experience an increase in non-high-income countries while the positive effect on indirect tax revenues in both the pre-production and production is present (absent) only in non-high income (high income) countries. This effect is largely driven by an increase in the consumption of goods and services. The results suggest that the abundance of natural resources might not be a reason why some of these countries mobilize less non-resource tax revenues.


### Chinese Development Aid and Agricultural Productivity: Evidence from Tanzania  [Working paper](http://papers.abrahamlartey.com/Abraham_Lartey_ChinaAgric.pdf){: .btn--research} [AidData Working paper](https://www.aiddata.org/publications/chinese-development-aid-and-agricultural-productivity-evidence-from-tanzania){: .btn--research} 
Improvement in agricultural productivity plays a key role in the process of economic development. Investment in critical infrastructure has been documented in the literature as one of the pathways to boost agricultural productivity. In this paper, I investigated whether foreign aid aimed at economic and social infrastructure can help improve agriculture productivity in Tanzania. I combined household panel data with rich farm level information with geocoded Chinese development projects. I then exploit the within village level variation in the total number of Chinese financed development projects in a panel fixed effects model to examine their effects on agricultural productivity. I find a positive effect on agricultural productivity in villages that are located within 25km of these projects. This is largely driven by economic infrastructure. The results are robust to alternative definitions of Chinese financed development projects. I also found that the mechanisms driving the results are commercialization and access to improved seeds. This suggests that these projects connect farmers to input and output markets.
