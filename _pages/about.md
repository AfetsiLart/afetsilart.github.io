Hello and welcome to my personal web page. I am  a PhD candidate at the [**Department of Economics, University of Alicante Spain**](http://fae.ua.es/FAEX/). My [**research**](research.md) interests lies at the intersection of energy, environment, natural resources and economic development. I'm also interested in using spatial and micro data to answer macro-development questions. 

During the first half of 2021, I worked as an consultant(Africa Fellow) with  the [**Energy & Extractives Global Practice of the  World Bank**](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/energy). In the summer of 2020, I was a PhD Intern with the [**International Monetary Fund**](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Recruitment/working-at-the-imf/fund-internship-program).
